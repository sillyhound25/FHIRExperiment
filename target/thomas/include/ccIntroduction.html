    <h4>Sample EMR selecting information via Profiles</h4>
    <p>Click the <em>Login & Select Patient</em> Link above to start with a demo user and patient</p>
    <p>You can select a real patient using the 'Find Patient' option</p>
    <p>Once a patient has been selected, there are 2 main parts to the page</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To the left are the 'vitals' - Medications, Problem List and Allergies. Entries are
            added to the list when an appropriate resource is created. Entries can be delete from the list
            by clicking the 'x' symbol. The Allergies maintains a history to the list as it changes
            over time.</li>
        <li>To the right is where new resources can be created from a profile. You select the resource you want
            to create and the form to populate it is displayed. You can enter a narrative in the
            textarea. Clicking 'save' saves the narrative (At the moment, the form contents are
            not saved. This will be fixed.) If the profile name matches one on the vitals, then you
            will have the opportunity to save it to the vitals list. The history of resources that are
            added is displayed on the right side, and there is also a preview tab</li>
    </ul>
    <!--
    <p>You can change the user by clicking the 'Change User' option on the top right of the navbar (Once logged in).</p>
    -->
    <p>The 'Allergy History' tab shows how the Allergy list changes over time.</p>
    <p><strong>Important!</strong> This is a demo app. The actual resources will eventually be saved
        (they aren't at the moment) but the Vitals lists are not. If following a scenario where the user
        changes - then just change the user as described above. Don't re-load the page, If you do, then
        the system will be reset.</p>
